    "#### MongoDB\n",
    "MongoDB is a NoSQL (non-relational database management system). MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model. In MongoDB, data is stored in flexible, schema-less documents, typically in BSON (Binary JSON) format. Documents can contain nested fields and arrays, making it well-suited for storing and querying hierarchical or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Relational Databases:\n",
    "Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, these are designed to handle various types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. They do not deend on the traditional tabular, row-and-column structure of relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Variety: NoSQL databases handle various data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-Tabular Structure: They don't rely on the traditional tabular structure of relational databases, making them more flexible in data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are often designed for horizontal scalability, allowing for distributed and large-scale data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Schema Flexibility: They offer schema flexibility, making it easier to adapt to changing data structures and evolving application needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases: NoSQL databases are suitable for applications dealing with unstructured or rapidly changing data, such as web applications, IoT, and big data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Not Ideal for Complex Queries: While NoSQL databases excel in certain scenarios, they may not be the best choice for complex queries and transactions that require strong data consistency.\n"
